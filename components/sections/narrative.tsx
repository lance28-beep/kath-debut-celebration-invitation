const ABOUT_TEXT = `Kaith is a lively, expressive person whose passion for dancing is evident in the way she moves and presents herself. She is kind-hearted and constantly demonstrates compassion and understanding for those around her. People are immediately at ease around her, as though they have known her for a very long time. Kaith is inherently a kikay, appreciating the small pleasures of fashion, self-care, and anything that enhances her individuality. She has an adventurous spirit that encourages her to travel, try new things, and live life to the fullest despite her gentle and playful side. Kaith is a truly remarkable person because of her dancing, warmth, kindness, adventure, and kikay charm.`
